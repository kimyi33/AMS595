# AMS 595 - Project 7: Basic Syntax of C++
This repository contains my C++ solutions for Project 7. This project implements several introductory C++ programming concepts, including:
* Conditional statements
* Vector printing
* While loops
* Prime checking
* Factorization and prime factorization
* Pascal's triangle using loops
* Organizing code across multiple `.cpp` and `.h` files

## Files
- `main.cpp` - runs all questions and prints results
- `functions.cpp` - implementations of all functions
- `functions.h` - declarations of all functions

---

## Usage
1. Complie : use the following command inside the project directory:
```bash
g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp functions.cpp -o project7
```
2. Run:
