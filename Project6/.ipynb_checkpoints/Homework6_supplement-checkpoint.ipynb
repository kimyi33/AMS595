After implementing the classification model, **report the indices of all the images in the test set for which the model's predictions are incorrect.** To maintain consistency with Python’s convention, please begin your indexing with 0.

The first 160 images plus the last digit of your Student ID will constitute the new training set, while the remaining images in the original training set will be your new test set. There are 209 images in the original training set. For example, if your ID ends with 0, the first 160 images will form your training set, and the remaining 49 images will be part of your test set. The test dataset is discarded and no longer used. Re-train the model using this modified dataset and **report the training and test accuracies**. Additionally, **provide the indices of all the images in the test set for which the model's predictions are incorrect. Display 4 of these misclassified images for further examination.**\n",
