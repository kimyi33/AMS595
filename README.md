# AMS 595 - Project 1: Monte Carlo Estimation of $\pi$
This repository contains my MATLAB solutions for Project 1: How to Find π.  
The project uses Monte Carlo simulation to approximate π using both for-loops and while-loops.

## Files
- `AMS595_project1_YK.mlx` : This script contains Task 1 and Task 2. 
- `mc_pi.m`: This is a MATLAB function that combines the logic from Task 2.
  - Input: Desired number of significant figures
  - Output: Estiamted value $\pi$
  - Features: Visualizes the random points being generated and estimated value of $\pi$

## Usage
Open MATLAB and run the script/function
